## How it works?





## Why it's absolutely undetectable?

|Feature   | Explanation  |
|---|---|
|✅ HackerRankGPT runs at the Computer Level   |HackerRankGPT runs on the PC, Mac, or Linux level and stays completely invisible from HackerRank. It runs on your computer, not in the browser, so HackerRank's cheat detection can't see it.   |
|✅ Displaying the Solution on a Separate Device   |The solution to the coding test will be sent and displayed on another device you choose (mobile phone, tablet, or another computer). In case the interviewers ask you to share your screen, you will be safe.   |
|✅ You can't Copy-Paste the solution   | HackerRank's anti-cheat system is capable of detecting contents in your clipboard and notice if you paste code. However, since the solution is displayed on a separate device, you can refer to it when needed and manually type it out, ensuring you stay undetected.  |
|✅ No Tab Switching needed   | HackerRank's anti-cheat system can flag tab-switching during a coding test as suspicious behavior. With the solution displayed on a different device, you can discreetly refer to it without the need to switch tabs, avoiding any red flags.  |
|✅ You don't need to copy the problem statement   | HackerRank's anti-cheat system can monitor your clipboard for copied content, including if you copy the problem statement. Our solution bypass this by taking a screenshot of your entire screen and automatically identifying the problem statement, ensuring you remain undetected.  |
|✅ HackerRank window always focused   | HackerRank's anti-cheat system tracks whether the browser window with the coding test is active or not. Frequent unfocusing could be flagged as suspicious. However, with the solution on a separate device, your test window remains consistently active, eliminating the risk of suspicion.  |





## Which languages does it support?
HackerRankGPT supports all languages and frameworks that GPT-4 is familiar with, practically covering a wide range. This includes Python, SQL, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, as well as logical and database problem solving. Additionally, it supports Ruby, Swift, PHP, Go, Kotlin, R, MATLAB, Perl... This comprehensive compatibility ensures users can tackle a diverse range of coding challenges across different platforms.
